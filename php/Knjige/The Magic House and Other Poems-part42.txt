hrough the wood.

    The demons danced about the trees,
      The snow slipped singing over the wold,
    And ever when the wind would cease
      A lynx cried out within the cold.

    A spirit walked the ringing rooms,
      Passing the locked and secret door,
    Heavy with divers ancient dooms,
      With dreams dead laden to the core.

    ‘Spirit, thou art too deep with woe,
      I have no harbour place for thee,
    Leave me to lesser griefs, and go,
      Go with the great wind to the sea.’

    I faltered like a frightened child,
      That fears its nurse’s fairy brood,
    And as I spoke, I heard the wild
      Wind plunging through the shattered wood.

    ‘Hast thou betrayed the rest of kings,
      With tragic fears and spectres wan,
    My dreams are lit with purer things,
      With humbler ghosts, begone, begone.’

    The noisy dark was deaf and blind,
      Still the strange spirit strayed or stood,
    And I could only hear the wind
      Go roaring through the riven wood.

    ‘Art thou the fate for some wild heart,
      That scorned his cavern’s curve and bars,
    That leaped the bounds of time and art,
      And lost thee lingering near the stars?’

    It was so still I heard my thought,
      Even the wind was very st
