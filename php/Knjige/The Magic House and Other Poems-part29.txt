nted to die too,
    For before you could think
    The birch cracked like a shell
    In that rush of hell,
    And I saw them both sink--

    Baptiste!--
    He had two girls,
    One is Virginie,

         THE END OF THE DAY


    I hear the bells at eventide
      Peal slowly one by one,
    Near and far off they break and glide,
        Across the stream float faintly beautiful
        The antiphonal bells of Hull;
    The day is done, done, done,
        The day is done.

    The dew has gathered in the flowers,
      Lake tears from some unconscious deep:
    The swallows whirl around the towers,
        The light runs out beyond the long cloud bars,
        And leaves the single stars;
    ’Tis time for sleep, sleep, sleep,
        ’Tis time for sleep.

    The hermit thrush begins again,--
      Timorous eremite--
    That song of risen tears and pain,
        As if the one he loved was far away:
        ‘Alas! another day--’
    ‘And now Good Night, Good Night,’
        ‘Good Night.’

         TO B. C.


    By a dim shore where water darkening
      Took the last light of spring,
    I went beyond the tumult, hearkening
      For some d
