rom the wet sands’ last wavy crease,
    Beneath the sea’s remote and sombre roar,
    To inland stillness and the wilds of peace.

    Death seems triumphant only here and there;
    Life is the sovereign presence everywhere.




         IN THE COUNTRY CHURCHYARD

         TO THE MEMORY OF MY FATHER


    This is the acre of unfathomed rest,
      These stones, with weed and lichen bound, enclose
      No active grief, no uncompleted woes,
    But only finished work and harboured quest,
        And balm for ills;
    And the last gold that smote the ashen west
        Lies garnered here between the harvest hills.

    This spot has never known the heat of toil,
      Save when the angel with the mighty spade
      Has turned the sod and built the house of shade;
    But here old chance is guardian of the soil;
        Green leaf and grey,
    The barrows blossom with the tangled spoil,
        And God’s own weeds are fair in God’s own way.

    Sweet flowers may gather in the ferny wood:
      Hepaticas, the morning stars of spring;
      The bloodroots with their milder ministering,
    Like planets in the lonelier solitude;
        And that white throng,
    Which shakes the dingles with a starry brood,
        And tells the robin his forgotten song.
