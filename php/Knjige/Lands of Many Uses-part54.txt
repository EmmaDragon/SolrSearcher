The Eddy Arboretum, named for its founder James G. Eddy, contains
species of pines from all over the world: 70 species, 35 additional
varieties, and 90 different hybrids. It was established in 1925 for
breeding and improving this group of timber trees. The Institute,
working to propagate faster growing, disease-resistant trees, is
successfully crossbreeding species such as Jeffrey and Coulter pines
into superior strains.
