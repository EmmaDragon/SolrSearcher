    The cows go lowing through the lovely vale;
      The clarion peacock warns the world of rain,
      Perched on the barn a gaudy weather-vane;
    The farm lad holloes from the shifted rail,

    A country of dim plain and shadowy height,
        Crowned with strange stars and silences supreme:
