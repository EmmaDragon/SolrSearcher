om the dingles,
      The sheep are gathering in frightened groups.

    From the wide field the laggards bleat and follow,
      A drover hurls his cry and hooting laugh;
    And one young swain, too glad to whoop or hollo,
      Is singing wildly as he whirls his staff.

    Now crowding into little groups and eddies
      They swirl about and charge and try to pass;
    The sheep-dog yelps and heads them off and steadies
      And rounds and moulds them in a seething mass.

    They stand a moment with their heads uplifted
      Till the wise dog barks loudly on the flank,
    They all at once roll over and are drifted
      Down the small hill toward the river bank.

    Covered with rusty marks and purple blotches
      Around the fallen bars they flow and leap;
    The wary dog stands by and keenly watches
      As if he knew the name of every sheep.

    Now down the road the nimble sound decreases,
      The drovers cry, the dog delays and whines,
    And now with twinkling feet and glimmering fleeces
      They round and vanish past the dusky pines.

    The drove is gone, the ruddy wind grows colder,
      The singing youth puts up the heavy bars,
    Beyond the pines he sees the crimson smoulder,
      And catches in his eyes the early stars.
