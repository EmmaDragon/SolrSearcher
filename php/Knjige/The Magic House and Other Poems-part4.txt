                      74

LA BELLE FERONIÈRE,

I never trod where Leonardo was,                                      75

A NOVEMBER DAY

There are no clouds above the world,                                  76

OTTAWA

City about whose brow the north winds blow,                           78

SONG

Here’s the last rose,                                                 79

NIGHT AND THE PINES

Here in the pine shade is the nest of night,                          80

A NIGHT IN MARCH

At eve the fiery sun went forth,                                      82

SEPTEMBER

The morns are grey with haze and faintly cold,                        86

BY THE WILLOW SPRING

Come hither, Care, and look on this fair place,                       87




A LITTLE SONG


    The sunset in the rosy west
      Burned soft and high;
    A shore-lark fell like a stone to his nest
      In the waving rye.

    A wind came over the garden beds
      From the dreamy lawn,
    The pansies nodded their purple heads,
      The poppies began to yawn.

    One pansy said: It is only sleep,
      Only his gentle breath:
    But a rose lay strewn in a snowy heap,
      For the rose it was only death.

    Heigho, we’ve only one life to live,
      And only one death to die:
