    Good-morrow, new world, have you nothing to give?--
      Good-bye, old world, good-bye.




         THE HILL PATH

         TO H.D.S.


    Are the little breezes blind,
    They that push me as they pass?
    Do they search the tangled grass
    For some path they want to find?
    Take my fingers, little wind;
    You are all alone, and I
    Am alone too. I will guide,
    You will follow; let us go
    By a pathway that I know,
    Leading down the steep hillside,
    Past the little sharp-lipped pools,
    Shrunken with the summer sun,
    Where the sparrows come to drink;
    And we’ll scare the little birds,
    Coming on them unawares;
    And the daisies every one
    We will startle on the brink
    Of a doze.
    (Gently, gently, little wind),
    Very soon a wood we’ll see,
    There my lover waits for me.
    (Go more gently, little wind,
    You should follow soft, behind.)
    You will hear my lover say
    How he loves me night and day,
    But his words you must not tell
    To the other little winds,
    For they all might come to hear,
    And might rustle through the wood,
    And disturb the solitude.
    (Blow more softly, little wind,
    You are tossing all my hair,
    Go more gently, have a care;
    If you lead you can
