wed frowns,
    But thou wilt grow in calm throughout the years,
      Cinctured with peace and crowned with power sublime,
        The maiden queen of all the towered towns.




         SONG


    Here’s the last rose,

    With the tulips gone
    And the lilacs strewn;
    A light wind blows
    From the golden west,

      Here where the strongest wind is lulled for him,
        He lingers brooding until dawn,
        While all the trembling stars move on and on.

    Under the cliff there drops a lonely fall,
      Deep and half heard its thunder lifts and booms;
    Afar the loons with eerie call
      Haunt all the bays, and breaking through the glooms
        Upfloats that cry of light despair,
        As if a demon laughed upon the air.
