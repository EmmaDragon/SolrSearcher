                45

OFF RIVIÈRE DU LOUP

O ship incoming from the sea,                                         48

AT THE CEDARS

You had two girls--Baptiste--                                         50

THE END OF THE DAY

I hear the bells at eventide,                                         54

THE REED-PLAYER

By a dim shore where water darkening,                                 56

A FLOCK OF SHEEP

Over the field the bright air clings and tingles,                     58

A PORTRAIT

All her hair is softly set,                                           60

AT THE LATTICE

Good-night, Marie, I kiss thine eyes,                                 63

THE FIRST SNOW

The field pools gathered into frosted lace,                           64

IN NOVEMBER

The ruddy sunset lies,                                                66

THE SLEEPER

Touched with some divine repose,                                      68

A NIGHT IN JUNE

The world is heated seven times,                                      70

MEMORY

I see a schooner in the bay,                                          72

YOUTH AND TIME

Move not so lightly, Time, away,                                      73

A MEMORY OF THE ‘INFERNO’

An hour before the dawn I dreamed of you,
