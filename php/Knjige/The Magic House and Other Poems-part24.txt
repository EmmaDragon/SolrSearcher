te St. Irénée.

    The sapphire hills on either hand
      Broke down upon the silver tide,
        The river ran in streams,
          In streams of mingled azure-grey,
    With here a broken purple band,
        And whorls of drab, and beams
          Of shattered silver light astray,
        Where far away the south shore gleams.

    I walked a mile along the height
      Between the flowers upon the road,
        Asters and golden-rod;
          And in the gardens pinks and stocks,
    And gaudy poppies shaking light,
        And daisies blooming near the sod,
          And lowly pansies set in flocks,
        With purple monkshood overawed.

    And there I saw a little child
      Between the tossing golden-rod,
        Coming along to me;
          She was a tender little thing,
    So fragile-sweet, so Mary-mild,
        I thought her name Marie;
          No other name methought could cling
        To any one so fair as she.

    And when we came at last to meet,
      I spoke a simple word to her,
        ‘Where are you going, Marie?’
          She answered and she did not smile,

    But oh! her voice,--her voice so sweet,
        ‘Down to St. Irénée,’
          And so passed on to walk her mile,
        And left the lonely road to me.
