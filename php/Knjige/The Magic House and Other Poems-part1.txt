A LITTLE SONG

The sunset in the rosy west,                                           1

THE HILL PATH

Are the little breezes blind,                                          2

THE VOICE AND THE DUSK

The slender moon and one pale star,                                    5

The wave is over the foaming reef,                                    15

THE FIFTEENTH OF APRIL

Pallid saffron glows the broken stubble,                              17

IN AN OLD QUARRY

Above the lifeless pools the mist films swim,                         19
