he blossoms clustered light,
      Then blow over to me.

    Wind, you are sometimes strong and great,
      You frighten the ships at sea,
    Now come floating your delicate freight
      Out of the lilac tree.

    Wind, you must waver a gossamer sail
      To ferry a scent so light,
    Will you carry my love a message as frail
      Through the hawk-haunted night?

    For my heart is sometimes strange and wild,
      Bitter and bold and free,
    I scare the beautiful timid child,
      As you frighten the ships at sea;

    But now when the hawks are piercing the air,
      With the golden stars above,
    The only thing my heart can bear
      Is a lilac message of love.

    Gentle wind, will you carry this
      Up to her window white;
    Give her a gentle tender kiss,
      Bid her good-night--good-night.




         THE SILENCE OF LOVE


    My heart would need the earth,
      My voice would need the sea,
    To only tell the one half
      How dear you are to me.

    And if I had the winds,
      The stars and the planets as well,
    I might tell the other half,
      Or perhaps I would try to tell.




         AN IMPROMPTU


    The stars are in the ebon sky,
      Burning, gold, alone;
    The wind roars over the rolling earth
