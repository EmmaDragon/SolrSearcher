fir, and even pine. The scientific name
meaning false hemlock (_Pseudotsuga menziesii_) honors Dr. Archibald
Menzies, physician and naturalist with Captain Vancouverâ€™s voyage, who
discovered this tree on the Pacific coast in 1791. It remained for the
roving Scotch botanical collector David Douglas to send the first seeds
to Europe in 1827. Soft, deep yellow-green or blue-green needles about
an inch long, flattened and pointed, grow all around the twig. The oval
cone with distinctive three-pronged bracts hangs like a pendant.
