     ‘To a large number of people these volumes will be more
     pre-eminently the book of the year than any other that has been, or
     is likely to be, published.... It is long since we have had a

     biographer.’--_Globe._

     ‘A noble monument of a noble subject. One of the most beautiful
     books about one of the noblest lives of our century. The volumes
     are exceedingly handsome, and the illustrations very
     beautiful.’--_Glasgow Herald._

     ‘It is indeed an excellent biography of Ruskin.’--_Scotsman._
