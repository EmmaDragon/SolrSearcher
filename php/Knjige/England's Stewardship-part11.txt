od himself.  When our merchants first settled on the banks of the
Hooghly, there was no thought of territorial possession.  In their first
acquisitions of property they were influenced merely by motives of
self-defence.  They were compelled to occupy districts surrounding them,
in order to protect themselves from aggression.  I fear that the same
cannot be said of our more recent annexations; but it was most
unquestionably the case when India was first placed in our hands.  Our
first merchants had no thought of a kingdom, but the providence of God
gave it us.
