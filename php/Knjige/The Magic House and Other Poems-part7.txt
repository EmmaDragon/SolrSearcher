      Floats tremblingly along the plain,
    Where in the reeds with fairy light
      The lingering fireflies gleam again.

    Buried in dingles more remote,
      Or drifted from some ferny rise,
    The swooning of the golden throat
      Drops in the mellow dusk and dies.

      A wave leaps silverly and stirs
    The rustling sedge, and then is gone
      Down the black cavern in the firs.

    It would be sweet to think when we are old
      Of all the pleasant days that came to pass,
      That here we took the berries from the grass,

    And spread the melon nets when nights were cold,
      Or pulled the blood-root in the underbrush,
      And marked the ringing of the tawny thrush,
    While all the west was broken burning gold.

    And so I bind with rhymes these memories;
      As girls press pansies in the poetâ€™s leaves
    And find them afterwards with sweet surprise;
      Or treasure petals mingled with perfume,
    Loosing them in the days when April grieves,--
      A subtle summer in the rainy room.
