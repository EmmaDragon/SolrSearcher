Come, O thou conqueror of the flying year,                            20

TO WINTER

Come, O thou season of intense repose,                                21

THE IDEAL

Let your soul grow a thing apart,                                     22

A SUMMER STORM

Last night a storm fell on the world,                                 23

LIFE AND DEATH

I thought of death beside the lonely sea,                             25

IN THE COUNTRY CHURCHYARD

This is the acre of unfathomed rest,                                  26

SONG
