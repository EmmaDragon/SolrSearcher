Forest Service, U.S. Department of Agriculture, is dedicated to the
principle of multiple use management of the Nation’s forest resources
for sustained yields of wood, water, forage, wildlife, and recreation.
Through forestry research, cooperation with the States and private
forest owners, and management of the National Forests and National
Grasslands, it strives—as directed by Congress—to provide increasingly
greater service to a growing Nation.
