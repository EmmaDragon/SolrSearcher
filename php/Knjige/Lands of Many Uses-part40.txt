see. The yellow-poplar reaches heights of 80 to 120 feet (maximum
recorded 198 feet) and diameters of 2 to 6 feet, with its straight,
deeply furrowed trunk clear of limbs for much of its length. It may live
250 years or more.

Hardly any American tree has a richer tradition than the yellow-poplar.
“Everyone,” wrote William Byrd, in his early _Natural History of
Virginia_, “has some of these trees in his gardens and around the house,
for ornament and pleasure.” Indians and settlers made dugouts of it. The
Delaware Swedes called it the “canoe tree.”
