ught perchance it was her face she saw
    And answered, beauty unto beauty’s law,
    But when they showed her image in a glass,
    She was not cured and nothing came to pass;
    So then they left her to her own strange will,
    And here she stayed when the fair pool was still.
    But when the wind would hurl the heavy rain,
    She peered out sadly from her window-pane;
    And when the night set wildly close and deep,
    She took her trouble down the dale of sleep:
    But when the night was warm and no dew fell,
    She waked and dreamed beside the starlit well.

    Then came a change, each day some offering
    She laid beside the clear soft flowing spring;
    And there she found them at the break of morn,
    And everything would take away forlorn;
    Until beside the unconscious spring was laid
    Each treasure held most precious by a maid.
    After, she offered flowers and often set
    A bowlful of the pleasant mignonette,
    And starred the stones with the narcissus white,
    And pansies left athinking all the night,
    Then ruffled dewy dahlias, and at last,
    When sundown told the summer-time had passed,
    The stainéd asters; but from day to day,
    Sadly she took the untouched flowers away.
    With autumn and the sounding harvest flute,
