     ‘“Barrack-Room Ballads” contains some of the best work that Mr.
     Kipling has ever done, which is saying a good deal. “Fuzzy-Wuzzy,”
     “Gunga Din,” and “Tommy,” are, in our opinion, altogether superior
     to anything of the kind that English literature has hitherto
     produced.’--_Athenæum._

     ‘These ballads are as wonderful in their descriptive power as they
     are vigorous in their dramatic force. There are few ballads in the
     English language more stirring than “The Ballad of East and West,”
     worthy to stand by the Border ballads of Scott.’--_Spectator._

     ‘The ballads teem with imagination, they palpitate with emotion. We
     read them with laughter and tears; the metres throb in our pulses,
     the cunningly ordered words tingle with life; and if this be not
     poetry, what is?’--_Pall Mall Gazette._
