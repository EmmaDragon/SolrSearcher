 Haunted with vain melancholy,
    A whip-poor-will wanders,
    Forcing his monotonous song.

    All the ancient desire
    Of the human spirit
    Has returned upon me in this hour,
    All the wild longing
    That cannot be satisfied.
    Break, O anguish of nature,
    Into some glorious sound!
    Let me touch the next circle of being,
    For I have compassed this life.




         AT SCARBORO’ BEACH


    The wave is over the foaming reef
      Leaping alive in the sun,
    Seaward the opal sails are blown
      Vanishing one by one.

    ’Tis leagues around the blue sea curve
      To the sunny coast of Spain,
    And the ships that sail so deftly out
      May never come home again.

    A mist is wreathed round Richmond point,
      There’s a shadow on the land,
    But the sea is in the splendid sun,
      Plunging so careless and grand.

    The sandpipers trip on the glassy beach,
      Ready to mount and fly;
    Whenever a ripple reaches their feet
      They rise with a timorous cry.

    Take care, they pipe, take care, take care,
      For this is the treacherous main,
    And though you may sail so deftly out,
      You may never come home again.
