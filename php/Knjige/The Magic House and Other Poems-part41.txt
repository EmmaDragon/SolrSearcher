aks from out his ebon sleep,
      When a brown cone falls near him through the dark;
    And when the radiant meteors sweep
      Afar within the larches wakes the lark;

        Leaving within the shadows deep,
        The haunting mood and magic of his sleep.

    And so we cannot come within this grove,
      But all the quiet dusk remembrance brings
    Of ancient sorrow and of hapless love,
      Fate, and the dream of power, and piercing things
        Traces of mystery and might,
        The passion-sadness of the soul of night.

      Flooding the clouds with ruby blood,
    Up roared a war-wind from the north
      And crashed at midnight t
