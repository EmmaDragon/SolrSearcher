   And folded in the fading night,
      I felt the dawning sink and cease.




         SEPTEMBER


    The morns are grey with haze and faintly cold,
      The early sunsets arc the west with red;
      The stars are misty silver overhead,
    Above the dawn Orion lies outrolled.
    Now all the slopes are slowly growing gold,
      And in the dales a deeper silence dwells;
      The crickets mourn with funeral flutes and bells,
    For days before the summer had grown old.

    Now the night-gloom with hurrying wings is stirred,
      Strangely the comrade pipings rise and sink,
        The birds are following in the pathless dark
        The footsteps of the pilgrim summer. Hark!
      Was that the redstart or the bobolink?
    That lonely cry the summer-hearted bird?

    Come hither, Care, and look on this fair place,
    But leave your gossip and your puckered face
    Beyond that flowering carrot in the glow,
    Where the red poppies in the orchard blow,
    And come with gentle feet; the last thing there
    Was a white butterfly upon the air,
    And even now a thrush was in the grass,
    To feel the sovereign water slowly pass.
    This pool is quiet as oblivion,
    Hidden securely from the
