ns that tilled the uplands in the sun
      Have all forgot the field’s familiar face,
      And lie content within this ancient place,
    Whereto when hands were tired their thought would run
        To dream of rest,
    When the last furrow was turned down, and won
        The last harsh harvest from the earth’s patient breast.

    O dwellers in the valley vast and fair,
      I would that calling from your tranquil clime,
      You make a truce for me with cruel time;
    For I am weary of this eager care
        That never dies;
    I would be born into your tranquil air,
        Your deserts crowned and sovereign silences.

    I would, but that the world is beautiful,
      And I am more in love with the sliding years,
      They have not brought me frantic joy or tears,
    But only moderate state and temperate rule;
        Not to forget
    This quiet beauty, not to be Time’s fool,
        I will be man a little longer yet.

    For lo, what beauty crowns the harvest hills!--
      The buckwheat acres gleam like silver shields;
      The oats hang tarnished in the golden fields;
    Between the elms the yellow wheat-land fills;
        The apples drop
    Within the orchard, where the red tree spills,
        The fragrant fruitage over branch and prop.
