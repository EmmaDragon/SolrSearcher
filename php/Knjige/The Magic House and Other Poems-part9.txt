,
      Like water over a stone.

    We are like things in a river-bed
      The stream runs over,
    They see the iris, and arrowhead,
      Anemone, and clover.

    But they cannot touch the shining things,
      For all their strife,
    For the strong river swirls and swings--
      And that is much like life.

    For life is a plunging and heavy stream,
      And thereâ€™s something bright above;
    But the ills of breathing only seem,
      When we know the light is love.

    The stars are in the ebon sky,
      Burning, gold, alone;
    The wind roars over the rolling earth,
      Like water over a stone.




         FROM THE FARM ON THE HILL

         TO A.P.S.


    The night wind moves the gloom
    In the shadowy basswood;
    Mysteriously the leaves sway and sing;
    So slow, so tender is the wind,
    The slender elm-tree
    Is hardly stirred.

    The sky is veiled with clouds,
    With diaphanous tissue;
    Through their dissolving films
    The stars shine,
    But how infinitely removed;
    How inaccessible!

    In the distant city
    Under the obscure towers
    The lights of watchers gleam;
    From the dim fields
    At intervals in the silence
    A cuckoo utters
    A distorted cry;
    Through the low woods,
