 tender death.

    Build a huge tomb within the desert frore,
    With green clear chambers in the icy rift,
    Carve the sleep rune above the crystal door,
    And trench a legend in the pallid drift.

    Let the large stars about the horizon lie,
    Watching the confines of the worldâ€™s great sleep;
    Spread the vast province of the purple sky,
    With thy wan curtains dropped from deep to deep.

    Then hush the stir and bid the movement cease;
    Pass gently, leave the tired world in peace.




         THE IDEAL


    Let your soul grow a thing apart,
      Untroubled by the restless day,
    Sublimed by some unconscious art,
      Controlled by some divine delay.

    For life is greater than they think,
      Who fret along its shallow bars:
    Swing out the boom to float or sink
      And front the ocean and the stars.




         A SUMMER STORM


    Last night a storm fell on the world
      From heights of drouth and heat,
    The surly clouds for weeks were furled,
      The air could only sway and beat,

    The beetles clattered at the blind,
      The hawks fell twanging from the sky,
    The west unrolled a feathery wind,
      And the night fell sullenly.

    The storm leaped roaring from its lair,
      Like the shadow of
