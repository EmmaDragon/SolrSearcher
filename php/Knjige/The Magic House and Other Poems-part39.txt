      That seem to crown the autumnal day,
    With rings of silver chased and pearled.

    The moistened leaves along the ground,

    The air is lingering in a swound;
      Afar from some enchanted shore,
    Silence has blown instead of sound.

    The trees all flushed with tender pink
      Are floating in the liquid air,
    Each twig appears a shadowy link,
      To keep the branches moor√©d there,
    Lest all might drift or sway and sink.

    This world might be a valley low,
      In some lost ocean grey and old,
    Where sea-plants film the silver flow,
      Where waters swing above the gold
    Of galleons sunken long ago.

    Peopled with deeds remembered for their woe.

    Thou art too bright for guile, too young for tears,
      And thou wilt live to be too strong for Time;
        For he may mock thee with his furro
