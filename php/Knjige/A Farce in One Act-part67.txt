ection for you!

VAN. (_to MRS. BOBBINS_) Come, madam! come with me! (_drawing her
towards him_) Let us be revenged upon them both.

MRS. BOBBINS. (_to VANDYKE_) Let me alone, sir! let me alone!
Augustus, come to my assistance! Why do you suffer him to treat me

(_BOBBINS turns his back to her indignantly._)

VAN. It's all fair! Exchange is no robbery! He takes my wife--I take
his. You see your husband does not object.

AUGUS. Not I! As she has two husbands already, she may as well take a
third. Clap hands and a bargain--I agree to the chop. (_meets in
centre and shake hands_)

MRS. BROWN.  BOBBINS.  BROWN.  MRS. BOBBINS.
     R.                              C.

MRS. BOBBINS. (_crying and crossing to L. C._) Oh, oh, Augustus! wha
