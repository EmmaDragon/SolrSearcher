ep and untold.

    And as the soft clouds opal-gray
    Against the confines of the day
    Seem lighter for the depth of skies,
    So, lighter for your saddened eyes,
            Your fair thoughts stray.

    I pluck a bunch before the spring,
    Of field-flowers reflowering,
    Upon a fell that fancy weaves,
    A memory lingers in their leaves
            Of songs you sing.

    You must have rested here sometime,
    When thought was high and words in chime,
    Your seed thoughts left for sun and showers
    Have blossomed into pleasant flowers,
            Instead of rhyme.

    And so I bring them back to you,
    These pensile buds of tender hue,
    Of crimson, pink and purple sheen,
    Of yellow deep, and delicate green,
            Of white and blue.

      Has filled your canvas curves with rose,
    And jewelled every toppling crest
      That crashes into silver snows!

    You know the joy of coming home,
      After long leagues to France or Spain;
    You feel the clear Canadian foam
      And the gulf water heave aga
