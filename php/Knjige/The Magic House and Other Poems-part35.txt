ken the serge and cord,
      And given the slip to the Devil.

    The winter’s loose somewhere,
      Gathering snow for a fight;
    From the feel of the air
      I think it will freeze to-night.




         THE SLEEPER


    Touched with some divine repose,
      Isabelle has fallen asleep,
    Like the perfume from the rose
      In and out her breathings creep.

    Dewy are her rosy palms,
      In her cheek the flushes flit,
    And a dream her spirit calms
      With the pleasant thought of it.

    All the rounded heavens show
      Like the concave of a pearl,
    Stars amid the opal glow
      Little fronds of flame unfurl.

    Then upfloats a planet strange,
      Not the moon that mortals know,
    With a magic mountain range,
      Cones and craters white as snow;

    Something different yet the same--
      Rain by rainbows glorified,
    Roses lit with lambent flame--
      ’Tis the maid moon’s other side.

    When the sleeper floats from sleep,
      She will smile the vision o’er,
    See the veinéd valleys deep,
      No one ever saw before.

    Yet the moon is not betrayed,
      (Ah! the subtle Isabelle!)
    She’s a maiden, and a maid
      Maiden secrets will not tell.




         A NIGHT IN JUNE
