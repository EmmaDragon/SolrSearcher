 that the tone and tenor of the memoir
     are thoroughly in harmony with the character and disposition of
     Keble himself.... All Churchmen must be indebted to Mr. Lock for
     this admirable memoir, which enables us to know a good and great
     churchman better than before; and the memoir, which to be
     appreciated must be carefully read, makes one think Mr. Keble a
     better and greater man than ever.’--_Guardian._
